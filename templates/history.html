              Korean beauty products is a booming industry in South Korea, and is now seeing popularity in the American scene.
              However, these products seem to aim a very specific audience, an audience with mostly pale skin, or those who want to have
              pale skin. The truth is, this "obsession" with having pale skin is written back in the history of Korea!
              Back in the Korean dynasty, the Korean Shamanism teachings stated that a person with white and pale skin is
              respected.

          <h4>
            Around 1867, when Korea welcomed in new people from different countries, Western media and
            mainstream culture became more accessible to Korean people. Koreans startetd adopting the
            Western beauty standards. With this impact of Western culture, pale skin determined whether
            a person was privileged, and would exempt them from doing manual labor.
            This would signify if someone was wealthy or not!!!

            This is very similar situation to Chapter 4 of the book <u> MEDIOCRE: THE DANGEROUS LEGACY OF WHITE MALE AMERICA</u> by Ijeoma Olou.
            The author mentions how the average American would more likely lose amazing job/school opportunities to someone who was white than someone
            who was a person of color.

            The rise in colorism in Korea has not stopped. According to Angela Phan, she mentions that over 44% of
            advertisements use White models. She also states how many of these advertisements avoid the use of local models.
            It is evident that the present times has been influenced a lot by the history of colorism in Korea, and while many
            activists are trying to demolish the Southeast Asian beauty standards, there is still a lot to be done in order for change.
